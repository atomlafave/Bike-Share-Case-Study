This case study completed in R Studio analyzes over 5 million rides of bike share data from March 2021 to February 2022 with specific tasks assigned by shareholders. It entails comparative analysis of two categories of riders and their ride behavior differences. I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency of R with various packages and other skills including: data aggregation, cleaning, filtering, modeling, casting, and visualizing data to fulfill stakeholder's requests.
