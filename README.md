This case study using R Studio analyzes over 5 million rides of bike share data from March 2021 to February 2022 with specific tasks 
assigned by shareholders. I aimed to highlight my understanding of the 6 steps of the data
analysis process, furthering my R Studio ggplot skills, as well as trying to use clear communication and summarization of what the analysis revealed. 
This was my second solo case study using R. I hope you enjoy it!
